# Rock-Paper-Scissor-with-Javascript

To create this game I used two file types.

I used an HTML file to create th index page
Then I create a boiler plate template with a script tage linking to a .js file.

The other file as mentioned was a JavaScript file.
In this file I wrote a program to play a game of "rock, paper, scissor".
I created the game to be played on the consol.
This game goes for 5 rounds and displays the results at the end..
There could be 3 out comes. You could win, loose, or tie.
